Rules of DSA:
  MOST IMPORTANT RULE:
    IF THE CODE IS GETTING BROKEN INTO TOO MANY FUNCTIONS, THERE IS A SIMPLER APPROACH
     - FLAW OF CODE WITH TOO MANY FUNCTIONS:
         - LOGIC IS MORE COMPLEX THAN IT NEEDS TO BE
         - HARDER TO TRACK WRONG FUNCTIONS + VARIABLES USAGE WHEN TOO MANY

  NEXT IMPORTANT RULE:
    TRY TO SIMPLIFY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, CONSOLIDATE INTO ONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
